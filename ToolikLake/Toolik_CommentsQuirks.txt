Seem to be available nutrient and chemical data for various lakes near Toolik Research Station for at least 2001-2009
(but doesn't seem to have all necessary variables)

Lake Nutrient data: http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/lakes/nutrients/index.shtml
Toolik Inlet discharge: http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/landwater/discharge/index.shtml

1988-2010_Kling_Akchem: daily data, but not all variables monitored continuously for time period
* includes inlets and outlets

Weather Data: http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/meta_template.php?FileName=./weather/tl/2007dltld.html
(daily weather summary files)

Secchi data: ARC_LAKES_Physchem_2000-2009.xls

DOC validation data: directly from George Kling: 2005-2008_Kling_Toolik_DOC.xlxs
* As instructed by Kling, I subbed out old discharge and inflow DOC with his updated values. Inflow DOC
* seemed noticeably different, but discharge minimally different

#########2005 Toolik Lake Data#########

for Toolik Inlet discharge (inflow), used average daily inflow for data days 

Secchi data for 7-29 were from 7-30

for SW_DOC: if multiple data entries on same day, used mean (measurement depths are all surface)
Toolik Main validation data for 7-8-05: suspiciously high surface depth value for DOC...11.55 at surface vs
4.67 at 1m...I used 1 m value (much more consisent with other days, depths)

#########2006 Toolik Lake Data#########

used surface (warmest) temp for epi temp
used deepest available temp for hypo temp
	7-7-06: hypo at only 9.5 m deep, where lake goes to 23 m deep

for Toolik Inlet discharge (inflow), used average daily inflow for data days (do we want total daily?)

Used data from 7-12-06 for validation of 7-14-06 (closest available)



No Secchi data for 7-21, 7-28 (and no substitutable dates)

for 8-25-06, used average discharge of 8-18 to 8-24 (no discharge available for 8-25) 

#########2007 Toolik Lake Data#########

for 7-13-07, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 7-15-07
for 8-10-07, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 8-8-07 (Secchi from 8-9)
for 823-07, no discharge available, so used average 8-18 to 8-21
for 9-19-07, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 9-20-07
for 9-28-07, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 9-29-07

8-9-07 data were used for 8-10-07 to even out time step by week
No Secchi data after 8-9

Toolik Main validation data for 7-13-07: suspiciously high surface depth value for DOC...11.02 at surface vs
5.07 at 1m...I used 1 m value (much more consisent with other days, depths)

Used validation data from 8-9-07 for 8-10-07
chla data from ARC_LAKES_Physchem_2000-2009.xls (different from Chl-a values in 2007_ArcticLTER_Lakes_nuts.xls...not clear if these are "corrected" or not)

#########2008 Toolik Lake Data#########
for 6-20-08, deepest depth measured was 5 m (used as hypo temp)
chla data from ARC_LAKES_Physchem_2000-2009.xls (different from "uncorrected" values in 2008_ArcticLTER_Lakes_nuts.xls)

for 6-27-08, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 6-26-08
for 7-11-08, two values for SW_DOC at 2 different times of day but at same depth, so took mean
for 7-25-08, two values for SW_DOC at 2 different times of day but at same depth, so took mean
for 8-1-08, two values for SW_DOC at 3 different times of day but at same depth, so took mean
for 8-8-08, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 8-7-08

Secchi data 7-18-08: average of two values (5.6, 4.5) avg=5.05 m
