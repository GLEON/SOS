Seem to be available nutrient and chemical data for various lakes near Toolik Research Station for at least 2001-2009
(but doesn't seem to have all necessary variables)

Lake Nutrient data: http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/lakes/nutrients/index.shtml
Toolik Inlet discharge: http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/landwater/discharge/index.shtml

1988-2010_Kling_Akchem: daily data, but not all variables monitored continuously for time period
* includes inlets and outlets

Weather Data: http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/meta_template.php?FileName=./weather/tl/2007dltld.html
(daily weather summary files)

Secchi data: ARC_LAKES_Physchem_2000-2009.xls

2005 Toolik Lake Data

for Toolik Inlet discharge (inflow), used average daily inflow for data days (do we want total daily?)

Secchi data for 7-29 were from 7-30

for SW_DOC: if multiple data entries on same day, used mean (measurement depths are all surface)

2006 Toolik Lake Data
used surface (warmest) temp for epi temp
used deepest available temp for hypo temp
	7-7-06: hypo at only 9.5 m deep, where lake goes to 23 m deep

for Toolik Inlet discharge (inflow), used average daily inflow for data days (do we want total daily?)

No Secchi data for 7-21, 7-28 (and no substitutable dates)


2007 Toolik Lake Data

for 7-13-07, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 7-15-07
for 8-10-07, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 8-8-07 (Secchi from 8-9)
for 9-19-07, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 9-20-07
for 9-28-07, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 9-29-07

8-9-07 data were used for 8-10-07 to even out time step by week
No Secchi data after 8-9

chla data from ARC_LAKES_Physchem_2000-2009.xls (different from Chl-a values in 2007_ArcticLTER_Lakes_nuts.xls...not clear if these are "corrected" or not)

2008 Toolik Lake Data
for 6-20-08, deepest depth measured was 5 m (used as hypo temp)
chla data from ARC_LAKES_Physchem_2000-2009.xls (different from "uncorrected" values in 2008_ArcticLTER_Lakes_nuts.xls)

for 6-27-08, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 6-26-08
for 7-11-08, two values for SW_DOC at 2 different times of day but at same depth, so took mean
for 7-25-08, two values for SW_DOC at 2 different times of day but at same depth, so took mean
for 8-1-08, two values for SW_DOC at 3 different times of day but at same depth, so took mean
for 8-8-08, no SW_DOC available, so used value from 8-7-08

Secchi data 7-18-08: average of two values (5.6, 4.5) avg=5.05 m
 
### VALIDATON DATA
12-17-18: can't seem to find in-lake DOC...found particulate carbon for 2005 (only yr of 2005-2008 with data)

# ToolikLakeValidationDO (contains DO and temp) (From ARC_Lakes_PhysChem_2000_2009)
Columns: datetime, Temp (C), DO_con (mg/L)
Depth: 0 m, except
6-17-05 (0.5 m)

DO_sat available 2007 and later

7-1-05: averaged two samples from same day
7-29-05: used data from 7-30-05
7-14-06: used data from 7-12-06
7-21-06: averaged two samples from same day
8-18-06: averaged three samples from same day
8-10-07: used data from 8-9-07
