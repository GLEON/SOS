Notes


Secchi depth: no, we don't have systematic measurements of secchi depth, 
but a guess from one of our limnologist-colleagues is 1.4 m. 
The lake is dystrophic to oligotrophic, and humic,

The lake catchment is small (4.8 km2) and mean annual discharge is 
something like 600 mm/yr. Small headwater catchment, and the inlet is the 
type of brook you can jump across, while the outlet is just a little to 
wide for that, for ordinary mortals.

1) The soils in the Langtjern catchment are very shallow, and we do not 
consider groundwater to be a significant inflow. You can safely consider 
all inflowing water to be surface water. And - as you can see the amount 
of Chl a data is limited. I am searching for some more, but currently this 
is what I have access to.

2) We have provided data for 2012-2014


3) The inlet data represent a subcatchment of 0.8 km2, while the total 
catchment is 4.8 km2. However, the catchment is very homogenous. I.e. the 
inlet discharge can be upscaled to the entire catchment using 4.6 (entire 
catchment - minus lake area)/ 0.8 (subcatchment area).

4) I have provided both concentration and flux data for TOC. We calculate 
the fluxes by linear interpolation of weekly or monthly concentrations to 
daily TOC, and multiplying with daily discharge

5)SW_DOC = TOC inlet_conc *0.9

6) EpiTemp = temperature at 1 m depth
   HypoTemp= temperature at 8 m depth

7) Volumen = surface * mean depth

8)DOC_init= 90% TOC outlet
 POC_init = 10% TOC outlet
