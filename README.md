We are a working group within Cohort 2 of the GLEON Fellowship Program. Our goal is to create a generalizable model for carbon flux in lakes. Ultimately, we hope to run this model across environmental gradients to better understand which factors determine a lake’s status as a net carbon source or sink.

Members (alpha order): Hilary Dugan, Kait Farrell, Paul Hanson, Ian McCullough, Mindy Morales, Derek Roberts, Facundo Scordo, Zutao Yang
