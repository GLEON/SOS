Trout Lake Comments & Quirks

Data compiled by: Kait Farrell (katiejfarr@gmail.com)

This file is to describe intricacies of data collection and/or massaging that went into the Trout Lake input data.

File name: TestDataTrout.csv
- datetime: Daily time (00:00 hours) from 6/16/2014 to 6/25/2015

- Volume: Constant volume based on XXXXXXXXXXXX

- FlowIn: Comprised of four known surface water flows (Stevenson, Allequash, North Creek, Mann Creek). Stevenson, Allequash, and North Creek have USGS gauges (05357225, 05357215, 05357230 respectively). Mann Creek includes less frequent point estimates of water discharge. Based on gauged flows, surface flows + estimated groundwater flows were less than the outflow (FlowOut, below). FlowIn was thus set equal to gauged FlowOut.

- FlowOut: Outflow volume from the one surface water outlet (Trout River: USGS gauge 05357245). Flow data compiled from USGS and daily estimates of discharge using the file USGS_flowdata_grab.R

- Rain: Currently no precipitation data is included for the test period (all values == 0).

- HypoTemp 

- EpiTemp

- TP: Total phosphorus was obtained via the North Temperatate Lakes LTER data portal 
(https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/datacatalog/search, file == North Temperate Lakes LTER: Chemical Limnology of Primary Study Lakes: Nutrients, pH and Carbon 1981 - current). We downloaded data from 2005-2013 (last year data available) and calculated mean unfiltered total phosphorus ('totpuf', microgramPerLiter) across sampled depths for each sampling day. Data were then interpolated to daily values. These functions were performed using the file gather_chla_TP.R

- Chla: Chlorophyll-a data was obtained via the North Temperate Lakes LTER data portal 
(https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/datacatalog/search, file == North Temperate Lakes LTER: Chlorophyll - Trout Lake Area 1981 - current) Chl-a from multiple depths (range: 0-32 meters) was sampled approximately monthly (fortnightly during ice-free season - every 6 weeks during 
ice-covered season). We downloaded chl-a data from 2005-2013 (last year data available) and calculated mean chl-a concentration across sampled depths for each sampling day. Data were then interpolated to daily values. These functions were performed using the file gather_chla_TP.R
