This file is to describe intricacies of data collection and/or massaging that went into the Trout Lake input data.

TestDataTrout.csv: Description of how each data column was obtained
- datetime: Daily time (00:00 hours) from 6/16/2014 to 6/25/2015

- Volume: Constant volume based on XXXXXXXXXXXX

- FlowIn: Comprised of four known surface water flows (Stevenson, Allequash, North Creek, Mann Creek). 
Stevenson, Allequash, and North Creek have USGS gauges (05357225, 05357215, 05357230 respectively). Mann Creek includes 
less frequent point estimates of water discharge. Based on gauged flows, surface flows + estimated groundwater flows 
were less than the outflow (FlowOut, below). FlowIn was thus set equal to gauged FlowOut.

- FlowOut: Outflow volume from the one surface water outlet (Trout River: USGS gauge 05357245). Flow data compiled from
USGS and daily estimates of discharge using the file USGS_flowdata_grab.R

- Rain: Currently no precipitation data is included for the test period (all values == 0).
